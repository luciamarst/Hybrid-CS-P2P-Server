# Hybrid Communication Server  
Hybrid Client-Server + P2P Server

This project implements a server with hybrid communications that combine the traditional model **Client-Server** with a system of **sporadic P2P connections** between clients.
The server handles coordination and authentication, while clients can communicate directly with each other when the application requires it, reducing latency and server load.

## Main features

- **Hybrid Architecture (C/S + P2P)**
  - Centralized server control
  - Optional P2P connections between clients

- **Low Latency**
  - Clients can open direct channels to exchange data.

- **Server as Mediator**
  - Handling signaling, permissions, and authentication.

- **Support for Sporadic Connections**
  - P2P is only established when needed.

- **Modular and Scalable**
  - Easily extendable for chat, gaming, IoT, file transfer, etc.

##  Arquitecture
```mermaid
graph TD
    Server

    subgraph Clients
        direction LR
        ClientA
        Spacer[" "]:::invisible
        ClientB
    end

    Server --> ClientA
    Server --> ClientB

    ClientA ---|P2P| ClientB

    classDef invisible fill-opacity:0,stroke-opacity:0;

```

1. Clients connect to the server.
2. The server coordinates the communication.
3. If necessary, clients establish a direct P2P channel.
4. If P2P fails, the server acts as a relay.
