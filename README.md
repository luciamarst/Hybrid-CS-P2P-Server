# Hybrid-CS-P2P-Server
This project implements a hybrid client-server + P2P model, where a central server manages the connection, authentication, and coordination, while clients can establish direct P2P channels when needed. It is ideal for applications requiring flexibility, scalability, and low latency in client-to-client communication.
